# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation for starting this course was to learn about the various elements that make up web design and improve my overall skills coding.

This was done for the prework study guide as an intro to the web development process.

I learned how to use gitbash to commit and maintain a repository for the prework study guide as well as various other aspects of web design such as:

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Github

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
